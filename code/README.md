## Code Copyright

Unfortunately I am not allowed to make my whole code publicly available.<br>
However I can share the architecture of my Recon-RLA encoder network, which you can find in the python file. It is implemented in Pytorch.<br>
If you are a member of the ETH CVG lab you can access the full code [here](https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/OU-POLLEFEYS/projects/ddr/ddr)<br>

In order to request the full code contact me via [E-Mail](mailto:nicolas.muntwyler@gmail.com)
